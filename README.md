# Single-cell-Expression-Analysis
A study for proposing a new technique of dimensionality reduction applicating Gene Ontology on single-cell RNA sequencing data matrices to obtain a significantly reduced data matrix that retains the biological processes in each cell and produces a near-identical clustering output to traditional techniques while using less computational power
